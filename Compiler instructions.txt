• On Linux, before compiling it is necessary to install the SDL2 libraries using
  "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0" and "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev".
  The application can then be compiled using the gcc on the command line with
  “gcc chip8emu.c chip8dis.c -o CHIP-8 -lSDL2”.

• On Windows, MinGW-w64 (or a similar system, like Cygwin) is required to run the gcc.
  The SDL library and dll is also required in the project folder (I have included these in the GitHub repository).
  The application can then be compiled with “gcc chip8emu.c chip8dis.c -I[Path to \SDL2\include] -L[Path to \SDL2\lib] -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -o CHIP-8”.
  For example, on my computer I used "gcc chip8emu.c chip8dis.c -IC:\Users/Thomas/c_projects\chip8\SDL2\include -LC:\Users/Thomas/c_projects\chip8\SDL2\lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -o CHIP-8"

• To run the application, it should be called from the command line with a Chip-8 file as the second command line argument.
